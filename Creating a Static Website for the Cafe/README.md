# 📝 Lab Steps

## Step 1 — Create an Amazon S3 Bucket

A new bucket named **cafe-ahmed-2026** was created with the required configuration.

- Bucket Name
- ACL Enabled
- Public Access configured
- Default Encryption enabled

---

## Step 3 — Enable Static Website Hosting

Static Website Hosting was enabled.

Configuration:

- Host a Static Website
- Index Document: `index.html`

---

## Step 4 — Initial Website Access Test

The website endpoint initially returned a **403 Access Denied** error because public access permissions had not yet been configured.

---

## Step 5 — Configure Bucket Policy

A public read Bucket Policy was applied to allow website visitors to access the uploaded files.

Additional permissions and ACL settings were also verified.

---

## Step 6 — Upload Website Files

Website content was uploaded to the bucket, including:

- index.html
- css/
- images/

---

## Step 7 — Enable Object Versioning

Versioning was enabled to preserve multiple versions of uploaded objects.

This provides protection against accidental deletion or overwriting.

## Step 8 — Create Lifecycle Rule

A Lifecycle Rule named **Move-Old-Versions** was created.

Configuration:

- Transition Noncurrent Versions
- Move to Standard-IA
- After 30 Days

---

## Step 9 — Verify Lifecycle Rules

The configured lifecycle rules were successfully added and enabled.

---

## Step 10 — Create Backup Bucket

A second bucket named **cafe-ahmed-backup-2026** was created to receive replicated objects.

---

## Step 11 — Configure Cross-Region Replication

Cross-Region Replication (CRR) was configured.

Configuration included:

- Source Bucket
- Destination Bucket
- IAM Replication Role
- Replication Rule
- Destination Region
